# Calorie-Companion

James Dabalos, Austin Rodrigues, Greg Plumblee, Jose Antonio Morales

Calorie Companion will find restaurants in the area that offer menus with calorie counts for each item on the menu. With one click the user gets a list of restaurant names, information, and maps to each location. By clicking on one of the choices, the user will get a larger view of that map and a link to the restaurant’s website.

Concept
	•	You’re on a diet and need to get a bite to eat at a local restaurant
	•	You want to log your calorie intake for the day
	•	You want to see the nutrition information for menu items at local restaurants
	•	You can’t decide what to eat on a menu so you want to choose the healthier item
