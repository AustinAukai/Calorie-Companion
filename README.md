# Calorie-Companion

James Dabalos, Austin Rodrigues, Greg Plumblee, Jose Antonio Morales

Calorie Companion will find restaurants in the area that offer menus with calorie counts for each item on the menu. With one click the user gets a list of restaurant names, information, and maps to each location. By clicking on one of the choices, the user will get a larger view of that map and a link to the restaurant’s website.

Concept
	•	You’re on a diet and need to get a bite to eat at a local restaurant
	•	You want to log your calorie intake for the day
	•	You want to see the nutrition information for menu items at local restaurants
	•	You can’t decide what to eat on a menu so you want to choose the healthier item

Team
James took the reins immediately, testing APIs to see what information could be obtained for use in the program. He wrote the core elements of the javascript code.
Austin implemented the frameworks from Materialize and stylized everything in CSS based on design elements Greg came up with. He and James worked closely together to get elements to work smoothly as the program developed.
Greg helped mainly in the design aspect of the application, creating graphics and slides, and choosing color schemes. Along with the rest of the team, he helped with concepts and layout.
Jose did frequent tests of the program, offering solutions for debugging issues with options for working around them.

Process
We chose Materialize CSS Framework because of its purported simplicity, but we found that it presented a number of challenges and limitations as we proceeded.
IPGeolocation API provided the user’s current location through their IP address. NutritionIX API gave us the locations of nearby restaurants that provided nutrition menus for customers. Maps Embed API from Google is where we got the maps that provided directions to each restaurant on the user list.

Challenges/Successes
As already stated, Materialize was difficult to work with. The load order in javascript had to be corrected a couple of times. For our first choice of application, we could not find an API to get the information we needed, so we had to move on to a new idea completely.
With trial and error, we got everything to work. We worked well as a team, each being strong in a different area.
